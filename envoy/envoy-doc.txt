Validating your Envoy configuration
You can start Envoy in validate mode.

This allows you to check that Envoy is able to start with your configuration, without actually starting or restarting the service, or making any network connections.

If the configuration is valid the process will print OK and exit with a return code of 0.

For invalid configuration the process will print the errors and exit with 1.


envoy --mode validate -c my-envoy-config.yaml

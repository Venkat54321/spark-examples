2)dimension table: Dimension tables (small tables) generally refer to fixed, less variable tables, such as contacts, items, etc., the general data is limited.



===============================================
Broadcast hash join :
--------------------------
1) Table needs to be broadcast less than  spark.sql.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold the configured value,
   default 10M (or add a broadcast join the hint)
2) Base table can not be broadcast, such as the left outer join, only broadcast the right table.

3) In broadcast hash join, copy of one of the join relations are being sent to all the worker nodes and it saves shuffling cost. This is useful when you are joining a large relation with a smaller one. It is also known as map-side join(associating worker nodes with mappers).
